# 🏗️ Machine Learning for Civil and Structural Engineers: The Fundamentals

## 📑 Overview
This repository contains code samples and notebooks illustrating the application of machine learning in civil and structural engineering. 
The first notebook is for predicting concrete strength. 
New Notebooks will be added periodically as a I develop them at work.
The code herein serves as a practical introduction to machine learning in the engineering domain.

## 🌟 Features
- 🔩 Linear Regression Model for Concrete Strength Prediction
- 🧠 Deep Learning Model for Concrete Strength Prediction
